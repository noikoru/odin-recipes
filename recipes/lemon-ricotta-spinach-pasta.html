        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>This vibrant lemon, ricotta, and spinach pasta is easy to fix as a side dish or a meatless main. It’s also customizable—feel free to add in chopped cooked chicken, or swap arugula for the spinach. You could use other small pasta shapes like farfalle, orecchiette, or radiatori.</p>

        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>1 pound fusilli corti bucati pasta</li>
            <li>1 cup ricotta cheese</li>
            <li>1/2 cup olive oil</li>
            <li>1/2 cup freshly grated Parmesan cheese, plus more for serving</li>
            <li>2 lemons, zested and juiced</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon salt, or to taste</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon Italian seasoning
            <li>1/2 teaspoon garlic powder</li>
            <li>1/2 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper</li>
            <li>1 pinch crushed red pepper flakes</li>
            <li>2 cups baby spinach</li>
            <li>small handful basil leaves, cut into very thin strips, or to taste</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon fresh thyme, or to taste</li>
            <li>lemon slices</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Add fusilli and return to a boil; cook until pasta is tender with a bite, 8 to 12 minutes. Reserve 2 cups pasta water, then drain. Return pasta to the pot.</li>
            <li>In a medium bowl, stir together ricotta, olive oil, Parmesan cheese, lemon juice, and lemon zest. Season with Italian seasoning, garlic granules, salt, black pepper, and a pinch of red pepper flakes.</li>
            <li>Add ricotta mixture and 1/4 cup reserved pasta water to pasta and toss. The sauce will thicken and adhere as it is tossed. Add more reserved pasta water if the sauce is too thick.</li>
            <li>Place spinach in a colander. Pour remaining reserved pasta water over spinach to wilt; toss spinach into pasta.</li>
            <li>Divide into serving bowls. Top each serving with a slice of lemon, basil, thyme, cheese and a drizzle of olive oil, if desired.</li>
        </ol>
